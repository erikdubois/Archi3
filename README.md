# Archi3 

A collection of scripts for a fast an easy installation of all software, icons, themes, cursors, ... automatically.

This is my configuration for I3 improved tiling to be used on any archlinux distribution.


I will be using the following elements : 


Sardi icons at AUR and [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sardi/files/)

Surfn icons at AUR and [Github](https://github.com/erikdubois/Surfn)

Aureola conky at [Github](https://github.com/erikdubois/aureola)

Plank themes at [Github](https://github.com/erikdubois/plankthemes)

More info can be found on http://erikdubois.be



In the installation folder are all the scripts for you to have a great working environment but not directly a desktop environment.

I do not work with a display manager like mdm, gdm,... Xorg and I3 provide all the display you will ever need.

I suggest you read up to better understand what a tiling window manager is.

It is really great once you have mastered the most important shortcuts.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
